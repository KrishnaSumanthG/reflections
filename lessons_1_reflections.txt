How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It made it easy

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I could check for similar situations i have faced and just look at how i solved it then.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manually saving gives u the right time to commit,automatic saving mite or mite not give this logical save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

these files may be linked to each other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log --stat shows what chnages with their captions and time...git diff pointing to those changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
very much

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
i want to check older and older versions and come back to newer versions.
